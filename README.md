# Digital Doctor
An Android app that gives the user a diagnosis. First the user enters some basic details (age, gender). Then the user searches their symptoms and based on the user details and symptoms the app asks the user questions. After awnsering enough questions the application shows a diagnosis  which is based on all the gathered information.

This is school project for the [Associate degree Software Development](https://sd42.nl) on the Saxion in Enschede, and was made in **3 days**, so don't look to much at code quality ;)

## How to use
If you want to run the app, you need access to the [Infermedica API](https://developer.infermedica.com/).
